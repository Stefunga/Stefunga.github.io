    Helpdesk Technician

    </h6>
    <h6>Helpdesk position at local college. This role was a formal introduction to IT work and the different problems technicians have to deal with.
    My job was to take calls from faculty and students, then address their concerns or push it down the line of command if i wasn't sure of a solution.
    I gained a strong grasp of working with others to resolve issues and communicating with staff that did not understand the complexity of a problem.
